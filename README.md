# bender-2.0
Bender, an alcoholic, telegram bot assistant for the Alcoholics Anonymous community.

A few years ago, at the request of friends, I developed a Telegram bot to assist the anonymous alcoholics community. It was warmly received by users and quickly became a part of their group. However, due to my lack of experience in Telegram bot programming and limited knowledge beyond my specialization, I made unfortunate technology choices. This mistake led to Bender 1.0 quickly reaching a development bottleneck. After completing courses and obtaining certification as an "IBM Full Stack Software Developer," I decided it was time to completely rewrite Bender, making it as user-friendly and autonomous as possible. Then, perhaps, it could be gifted to all recovery communities following the 12-step program. 

The project is in its early stages, and I would be grateful for any assistance from passionate individuals.
